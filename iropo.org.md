ORI Number - nine characters (A & B): This is the unique nine-character NCIC
Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) Number that has been assigned to each agency. It must be included in each Group “A” Incident Report Segment or Group “B” Arrest Report. Federal agencies’ ORI numbers are a combination of the ORI number of the agency, which has jurisdiction in the location of the incident, and the Federal Agency Identifier (FID), which is assigned to them by the FBI’s UCR Program.
Example: The ORI Number for the New York City Police Department is NY0303000. If the FBI in New York City reports a crime, the ORI would be NY03030JF: NY03030 indicating New York City as the location of the offense and JF indicating the FBI as the reporting agency.
